## Problem solving skills

 Passionate about problem solving, often spending hours and hours trying to work out the right solution to the problem. Double winner of the 1st place in Polad in creativity and problem solving competition in teams, won 4th and 6th place in the international comptetion in the USA. 
 Always looking for the right solution. One of the most interesting part of my final project was writing KNN algorithm to give our program ability to learn to identifying bots. Here is our program learning who is a bot and who is not on Twitter using News and Twitter APIs.
