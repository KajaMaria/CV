## Problem solving skills

 Passionate about problem solving:
 - Double winner of the 1st place in Polad in creativity and problem solving competition in teams, won 4th and 6th place in the international comptetion in the USA. 
 - Always looking for the right solution. One of the most interesting part of my final project was writing KNN algorithm to give our program ability to learn to identifying bots. Here is our program learning who is a bot and who is not on Twitter using News and Twitter APIs.

## Fast learner 

I have repeatedly demonstrated my ability to teach myself new skills and then excel in adapting to any situation and in turn, passing my learning on to others. I have developed and enhanced these partnered learning skills from my early progression in my previous role where i was fast tracked for promotion, then in leading one of the new ideas teams within the company.
 Two years ago i have also started Brazilian jiu Jitsu which has quickly became my passion and with a great support of other members i was promoted to a blue belt. Sharing my newly learner skills is incredibly important to me, so thrive when I am around other passionate people.

I enjoy working in challenging environments and developing or learning from others. For this reason I have chosen a career in software development with its continuous problems and infinite depth of learning.
